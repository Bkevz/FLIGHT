# Flight Service Development Notes

## [2025-01-07] ThirdPartyId Configuration Analysis Completed

### Issue Identified
The current implementation uses a static `ThirdPartyId` header configuration for all API calls, but different airlines require their specific airline code in this header for FlightPrice and OrderCreate operations.

### Root Cause
- **Header vs. Payload**: The `ThirdPartyId` header must match the airline code, not just be a generic identifier
- **Endpoint Requirements**: FlightPrice and OrderCreate operations are airline-specific and require the correct airline identifier

### Current Implementation
- Static configuration: `VERTEIL_THIRD_PARTY_ID` set to a single value
- Used for all API calls regardless of airline
- Located in `services/flight/core.py` in the `_get_headers()` method

### Evidence Found
- Configuration in `core.py` line ~140: `'ThirdpartyId': self.config.get('VERTEIL_THIRD_PARTY_ID', '')`
- Same header used for all endpoints (AirShopping, FlightPrice, OrderCreate)
- No dynamic airline-specific header logic present

## Recommendations

1. **Match ThirdPartyId Header with Airline**: For FlightPrice and OrderCreate operations, the `ThirdPartyId` header should match the airline of the selected offer (e.g., 'KQ' for Kenya Airways, 'WY' for Oman Air).

2. **Dynamic Header Configuration**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Implemented logic to dynamically set the `ThirdPartyId` header based on the airline code extracted from:
   - For FlightPrice: Extract from the selected offer in the AirShopping response
   - For OrderCreate: Extract from the FlightPrice response

3. **Fallback Mechanism**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Maintained the current configuration-based approach as a fallback when airline code cannot be determined from the response data.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made (2025-01-07)

**Core Service Updates (`services/flight/core.py`)**:
- Modified `_get_headers()` method to accept optional `airline_code` parameter
- Updated `_make_request()` method to pass airline code to header generation
- Implemented fallback to configuration-based `ThirdPartyId` when no airline code provided

**FlightPricing Service Updates (`services/flight/pricing.py`)**:
- Added `_extract_airline_code_from_offer()` method to extract airline from AirShopping response
- Modified `get_flight_price()` method to extract and pass airline code to API requests
- Implemented robust error handling for airline code extraction

**FlightBooking Service Updates (`services/flight/booking.py`)**:
- Added `_extract_airline_code_from_price_response()` method to extract airline from FlightPrice response
- Modified `create_booking()` method to extract and pass airline code to API requests
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging

**Testing (`tests/test_dynamic_third_party_id.py`)**:
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all dynamic `ThirdPartyId` functionality
- Tests include airline code extraction, header generation, and error handling scenarios
- Validates both FlightPrice and OrderCreate operations

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Dynamic Airline Detection**: Automatically extracts airline codes from API responses
2. **Intelligent Fallback**: Uses configuration default when airline cannot be determined
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of malformed or missing data
5. **Full Test Coverage**: Complete test suite ensuring reliability

### Technical Details:

**Airline Code Extraction Logic**:
- **FlightPrice**: Extracts airline code from the selected offer in AirShopping response by matching `offer_id`
- **OrderCreate**: Extracts airline code from the `Owner` field in FlightPrice response
- **Fallback**: Uses `VERTEIL_THIRD_PARTY_ID` configuration when extraction fails

**Header Generation**:
- Dynamic `ThirdPartyId` header based on extracted airline code
- Maintains all other headers (Authorization, Content-Type, etc.)
- Backward compatible with existing configuration

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful degradation when airline code cannot be extracted
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
